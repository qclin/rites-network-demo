
hey guys happy anniversary for those who
don't know today is the 7-year
anniversary of this channel and
basically my entire career this is a
story of a girl who made a video and
then everything changed but it was for
the better
and ultimately the effort I you know
what I don't know the melody I don't I
don't know that song today is my seven
year anniversary which means that I have
been lucky enough to be making videos
for you guys for seven years that's
crazy to me that's nuts I can't even
believe it and so today to celebrate the
seven year anniversary I am doing two
things big number one launching a new
store go ahead and check it out the
photos are great they are my my friend
Luke Fontana and the merch itself is
even better so if you guys want to go
and get some go ahead it's over here
happy anniversary to all of us now let's
get to the content so today for my seven
year anniversary I've decided to
re-watch my very first video ah in that
video originally titled buddy oh shit I
decided to get drunk and make a grilled
cheese sandwich for my friend Hannah
because we missed each other and she was
feeling blue and making each other laugh
and getting drunk and cooking is just
what we did and that's it guys that's
the whole thing but today I'm going to
watch that entire video again one more
time and relive the memories with you
guys right here right now so let's do it
Oh
I mean how do I even find this episode
what oh it's right there buddy Yoshi
good here we go five minutes and 20
seconds twenty-one seconds of just pure
cringy goodness hello
yep welcome to my drug oh god you guys
know that while I was editing this I
thought I had cleavage oh there she goes
uh-huh oh oh that's why I started
getting my wrinkles mm-hmm oh drinking
the wine look at that haircut I guys can
I tell you the story behind this haircut
I got a pause it right there right
before the opening credits that haircut
right there that we're looking at
together Oh God
that was my cool New York haircut that
was a haircut I went to a special barber
shop in Williamsburg and asked them to
do to my head it was the first time I
cut my hair that short oh wow how could
they have cut my hair like that and then
let me walk out it was truly a bad
haircut oh yeah okay another fun fact
that wine is a lambrusco that's why it's
frothing people were always like why is
there that's not really wine
look at those bubbles on top sorry guys
it was it's a sweet Italian questionmark
wine that's effervescent and so it has
bubbles yeah but people are like that's
juice she's just making this up like who
would you who why for what points to the
YouTube glory in 2011 hmm I lost that
hack and I loved it when you're drunk
yep
it's important to remember that if
you've been drinking yeah you should be
also dancing the jokes whoa you should
also be drinking a lot of water I also
thought it was really really scandalous
that I wore just the tank top in a shot
what can I say
also I really believe in something I
like to call second puberty which is
where your body and your face just
change like in your mid-20s I swear to
God
second puberty is a thing okay because
alcohol okay so I was really proud of
that edit in iMovie I thought that
sprinting back and forth I learned how
to make it go faster out make sure it's
truly used to puke a lot French it is a
show about friendship but hello so let's
talk about grilled cheese sandwiches do
you like them yeah all the time
first thing you guys do not be drunk
when you're cooking then didn't do bad I
definitely stayed drunk cooking all the
way up until yesterday check out
yesterday's new video my drunk kitchen
mini Shepherd pie where I need a recipe
that was truly delicious and also I feel
very evocative of these old and Dave
vibes I still feel that way I want a
burrito right now this is your cooking
pan I still call them cooking pan no
yeah no hat oh oh my god it's so many
lesbian Daiki if you're watching this
you are in front of the computer oh wait
oh my god what a cutie patootie I kind
of get it now okay bread you better
you might be thinking right now why
don't I just make some toast oh ha ha I
can't swear anymore on the Internet okay
so okay I also want to point out that
there's no music under this not it which
I'm really shocked by because I always
put music under all my videos now not so
good
I don't know about hygiene did that
toilets you don't have a li okay the line did that toilet see even
have a lid comes from the night before
the night before before I was at a bar
and I think called the Lexington I think
anyway it didn't have a toilet seat was
it that no that's in San Francisco I
thought some really div' bar in Brooklyn
and there was no toilet seat and I I
found out you know how ya guys washing
hands it's important it's porn for you
remember when cooking to use food always
use a butter knife for everything don't
fuckin hurt yourself listen I definitely
have abandoned the butter knife
philosopy have an eye one delicious
number two easy to eat okay number two
easy mate
who nobody else is there that laughs
that laugh was just to me for me I was
like what are you doing like truth oh my
god baby guys I know what you're
thinking
now you're probably not thinking this
but here's why I'm thinking what's with
that bright green hoodie in that bright
blue top well not even what's the look
that I'm rather thinking boy I used to
really dress myself just based off
colors I liked and then I would put them
together regardless of whether or not
they matched I just like to see them
because one of the things about becoming
a person on the Internet
it's suddenly you get permission to
everybody around you and this is
true.you grant this permission to
comment on everything about you and
times after seven years it starts to get
in your head and that's just the truth I
would love to say that the words of
others don't have any effect on me but
if I did feel that way I would be a
sociopath don't forget it you're cooking
so this little cookie adventure I don't
actually have any cheese yeah that was
really disappointing don't do that
mm-hmm I really thought I had cheese
make sure you have good make sure you
have cheese in your house yeah I know I
really wish you did to Hannah good but
ultimately disappointing winning I don't
even watch this video that much this is
just what I would say if I was in that
moment right now oh god no it's gone
next week we're gonna make a cute
although maybe that time I should
probably make sure we have cheese beforrevelations
Oh God revelations oh my god do you guys
remember we used to end every video with
end credits because I thought it was so
funny oh my god
on a serious note don't beat your kids
and then look at all these little bonus
bloops with the word Twitter okay and a
nice little fade to black Wow
god that is so crazy to watch you know I
don't do a lot of react videos so I
don't really know how much I should be
speaking during versus just watching I
wonder you know when I edit this later
is it gonna be hard to sync it all up
but I hope so
oh you guys wow wow wow wow what a time
you know it's so funny to be watching
this
seven years later cuz I have to tell you
I was so debating about whether or not
to make another video after of course it
was like a response to it and people
like oh my god people love this you
should do another I'm like people want
me to get drunk for a living that
doesn't seem like a good idea at all
it seems really stressful because about
what about sometimes when I don't want
to drink good news is is that you get to
make choices for the path that you want
back in the day back in 2011 I was
really concerned with becoming
quote-unquote that drunk girl from my
drunk kitchen but my drunk kitchen is
also the thing that gave me the
opportunity to be here so it's just
about me managing that you know enemy
but like managing in a good way like
being like this is something I love to
do this is something I have fun with and
this is something that's not gonna be in
control of my entire life I'm not just
gonna be one joke because I'm just not
one thing that being said will I
continue to make episodes of my drunk
kitchen until I don't want to well yeah
duh I make him whenever I want and that
is great it makes me really happy and
it's a freedom that has been afforded to
me only because if you guys for watching
all the videos I make not just my drunk
kitchen but the other things I do most
recently the podcast thank you guys so
much for listening to that and being
responsive to it thank you I'm really
really really am
you know when I talk to people about my
community I always say like well they're
just cool adults don't know what to tell
you click like if you're a cool adult
man anyway long story short happy seven
years of hannover sorry it's so fun
because after seven years of being
online I've got to not only watch myself
grow as a creator but watch the platform
do whatever it's been doing
long story short thank you guys for
being with me after seven years thank
you for supporting all my projects the
podcast included which I really really
love and I'm so proud of and can't even
believe how much you guys have enjoyed
listening to it thank you for supporting
my drunk kitchen through all these years
because I take everything I do really
personally because everything I make
comes from a very personal place and
when you support more than just my drunk
kitchen it makes me feel like we're the
kind of friends that don't just party
together like we could like go on a walk
together or go to a museum or make food
not while drinking or go to a picnic and
then also party together
and that's the best kind of friendship
there is to more than just party friends
boom Wow oh and then the other day I met
this woman who said that she named her
hamster Frederick after Frederick and
that made me so happy a love of moments
like that happened every time people say
something like I've been watching you
since the beginning they always say in
this like slightly embarrassed like
silly way and you know as if I've become
there's suddenly like incredible
mainstream success which I understand
why someone would feel compelled to do
that but if you're that person who has
supported me since the beginning thank
you
like it's so funny to me because I look
at that person that video and when I say
this I don't I don't mean it in a
negative way but I can barely recognize
myself not just exteriorly
like how much my exteriors changed but
more like I know what my internal world
was like and I'm just so happy to be
where I am now so to encouraging each
other while also keeping each other in
check
you know accountability is king but so
is compassion and forgiveness and that's
pretty much it for me oh but on a
serious note don't beat your kids
[Music]

- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley.
Today, I am celebrating Valentine's Day
because it's like, coming up.
And it's the worst holiday of all time.
So I felt like because we're
going through this together,
let's just address the
elephant in the room.
We are all single. It's
fine, it's whatever.
And as somebody who is single, I feel like
if I want to have a boyfriend,
I gotta put myself out there,
and that includes some dating apps.
But I feel like me being
single is not always my fault.
Though, sometimes it is, I feel like you
gotta meet me halfway and the messages
that I get on these apps are
not always the most normal.
So, today I am going to
be sharing with y'all
some of the weirdest,
cringe-iest, not-normal
messages that people send me on Grindr.
I can't believe I'm about
to share these messages
because some of them
are a little bit much.
This one, this is a common theme
for messages that I get on Grindr.
And it's people that seem
to almost know who I am.
It's not the superfans that are like,
"Oh my god, Tyler Oakley!"
It's people that are like, "Taylor!"
And I'm like, you were
so close (laughs loudly).
This one says, "WATCHA
doing here. TAAAAYLOR"
That's not who I am, I'm
not Taylor, but thank you
for almost gettin' there with
me. Here we go, another one.
This one says, "Oh my fuck.
"Please tell me you're Taylor Oakley.
"THE Taylor Oakley." (laughs loudly)
I wanna be like, yeah it's me,
the one and only, Taylor Oakley.
Maybe that's my drag name, Taylor Oakley.
Please welcome to the
stage, Taylor Oakley.
(laughs loudly) Somebody
says, "Shut it down.
"If this is Taylor, I have
followed you since forever."
Just, a true fan (laughs loudly).
(laughs loudly and grunts)
This is another theme
where people try to get
my attention by saying
that they love me and
that they're a huge fan
and then if I don't immediately
reply, this took one minute,
they say, "JK, not that big of a fan,
"but I still look at your videos."
Thank you. You really built me up,
and then you really tear me down.
This one, okay so, they messaged me,
"Hey you're cute what's up?"
And then I didn't reply fast enough.
People get really upset when
I don't reply fast enough.
I'm like, you know what, I don't have
push notifications on for this.
So, I didn't reply fast enough,
and then their next message was,
"unsubscribed." Period. (laughs loudly)
These impatient bottoms!
So, this one says, "Hey!"
And then it's the moon emoji,
and it says, "sending you a sexual moon."
And I was like, who's pickup line?
And Lord knows I probably
sent this to Cory
because we always send each
other the shady moon emoji
and I've never used like,
the non-shady moon emoji,
and maybe it is a sexual moon.
Maybe Devon is really
opening up my eyes to this.
(laughs loudly)
JT says, "Good meningitis"
and then corrects himself,
"Morning," I meant morning.
That's iconic. Good
meningitis (laughs loudly).
Ooh no, no. I think...
This is from a trip that
I went on to Seattle.
This isn't a screenshot of Grindr.
This is a screenshot of me
falling asleep with Grindr open.
(laughs loudly)
Somebody posted it, they said,
"Napping on grindr. Classic Ty."
This must've been Cory or
something. I, this is great.
This is the most me. Just networking,
but falling asleep doing it.
(laughs loudly) This person says,
"Ur my 4th favorite youtuber!"
Who the fuck is on top of me?" (laughs)
This message just says,
it's very sweet, it says,
"You are hot." But this like...
graphic, like, emoticon situation
of a naked guy pointing with his dick out.
I need to know if this is like,
a saved message you send to everyone.
Is this always what you lead with?
I just say "hey," or like,
"hey hey," sometimes.
Or "hey there" with a smiley face.
I guess I need to step my game
up, this is like next level.
Oh my god! Some of these screenshots
are a little bit triggering.
This one says, "You look like
that faggot Tyler Oakley."
(laughs loudly and grunts)
I don't know, are we reclaiming
that word? Not on my watch.
(laughs loudly)
Somebody says "Hi. Why is
Tyler Oakley ur profile pic?"
And then they send me a side by side
of them and me, our two pictures.
They say, "Little girls
always think I'm him."
Sad face, I'm sorry.
I get it a lot too.
People think I'm Taylor
Oakley all the time.
I do get this a lot
though when guys are like,
everyone says I look like you.
And every time the gay
that's telling me that
seems so annoyed, I'm like,
I can't help it, I'm sorry.
I feel like there's no better insult
than to be told you
look like Tyler Oakley.
So, Dear all white gays that
are blonde with glasses,
I am so sorry.
Another theme we have going on.
This one comes from a man who's
got a hammer emoji as his name.
Does that mean he's gonna pound me?
I don't know what that means, but he says,
"Why would you use a fake picture?
"I doubt a youtuber
would come in to Grindr.
"But nice try whomever is hiding there."
I wanna be like, you know
what bitch, we need dick too.
We need that pound too (laughs).
(laughs) This is...
The closest that I probably
get in conversations on Grindr
to sexting, is something like this:
He says, "I'll let you dip
pizza in ranch on my chest."
I said, "Oh my god. Do not say
that if you don't mean it."
He says, "I'm into it. Just like.
"Let it be full fat hidden valley."
Which to me, girl. So I said, "Omg."
He says, "Anything else is offensive."
Which is true! We are really
like, on one right here.
I feel like we are connecting, I wonder
if this ever turned into anything.
I said, "I do not even
know how to respond to you.
"You might be my soulmate."
He says, "My queen Tiffany HBIC
pollard taught me the way."
This must've been my soulmate; did I miss
my opportunity with this person?
Who was this? If this was
you, I hope that we hooked up.
Oh my god! Another critique
on my profile picture.
This person says, "You
look like you just farted
"and you're waiting for
somebody to smell it."
Like, what does that mean?
I need to know what my profile
picture was at that time.
Honestly this productive,
constructive criticism is helpful.
One thing that I hate to see on Grindr
is when people are like, no
fats, no fems, no blacks,
no this, no that, or whatever.
'Cause I'm just like, girl, imagine being
that close-minded to love and possibility
and knowing what could be out there.
But this one I screenshotted
because I'm like,
this is a taste of somebody's
own medicine because it says,
"No white guys. Literally anything else."
I'm like, girl, after all
the no blacks, no asians,
no blah-blah-blah, this might be
refreshing for a white guy to see.
Oh, this is a Grindr
screenshot that I took
but it has nothing to do with Grindr.
It was just the moment I
got the push notification
that Darren Criss started
following me on Twitter.
So (laughs loudly),
I was on Grindr the moment
it happened, what a memory.
(sighs) This guy says,
"So I saw you in weho
the other night. Wow.
"You do not even come close
in person as good as you do
"in your profile picture on here.
"I was shocked how not
good-looking you are in person,
"keep working that pic
though, it over sells you."
Thank you, Chuck. Thank
you for that feedback.
I think I'm cute. You don't gotta.
Truly, what is there to say Chuck?
Clearly, we didn't vibe in person.
Clearly, we're not vibin' on
here. I wish you the best.
(laughs loudly) This one just says,
"Hey, yo whassup vanilla
face." (laughs loudly)
I would love if I were truly
that, because I feel like
I'm always just like, red and blushing.
We love a business
opportunity. This person says,
"Wanna model for us. We pay
$2000 for a solo jack off video"
Girl, that's not a bad
idea. (laughs loudly)
You know what, that might
work for some people.
If that is for you, get your coins.
I will link to them in the description
if you wanna give them that content.
(laughs loudly and grunts)
This first message from somebody says...
I can't, I don't wanna read
it. It's so inappropriate.
"I can fuck you deep and hard
"and you can post it on
your YouTube channel."
No, thank you. It's sweet
though, it's a kind offer.
I just don't know if that's
what we're posting today on
YouTube.com, Tuesdays at
noon. It's not the video.
It's not next week's
video, it's not the one.
See! It is not all my fault
that I'm single (laughs loudly).
Thank you for joining
me on this adventure.
Please, if you see me on
any of your networking apps,
say hello but don't be a weirdo.
If you like this video, be
sure to give it a thumb's up
and let me know in the comments if
you were to message
somebody on Grindr, what is
a pickup line you would send?
And if I'm gonna be honest,
the best Valentine's gift
you could give me is giving this video
a thumb's up and subscribing,
so if you do that, God bless ya.
Okie dokie, that is all I
have for you guys today.
I will see you guys very soon.
Happy Valentine's Day. Love ya. Later!
